**Rainbow Project**

**The main branch**
1. Created a new file in local,named rainbowcolours.txt.
2. Added lines to the file. And it was the initial commit.

**Branches**
Each team member created their own branches and tried to add new lines of text to the same file.
This caused merge conflicts, which was resolved by the team members, merged to main branch and the branches were deleted.
